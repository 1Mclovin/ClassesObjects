Lets understand what a class is.

Think of this

A class is like a blue print of something it could be a blueprint of an animal.
we are modeling a real world entity by using a class

we can say for our class we want to create the blueprint of a bird.

what do we know about birds?
some birds can fly
birds have breeds
birds have names (if you wanna give it a name)
birds have eyes
birds have legs
birds have an age

these attributes would be called instances.^^^

now we can create a class.
